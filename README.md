### Arbitrage in Sports Betting: Maximizing Profits through Strategic Wagering

Arbitrage, often referred to as "arb'ing," is a technique employed in sports betting to exploit inconsistencies in bookmakers' odds. By strategically placing multiple bets on the same sporting event, where the combined "implied probabilities" fall below 100%, bettors can ensure a profit regardless of the outcome. This article delves into the concept of arbitrage, differentiates it from traditional gambling, explores the advantages it offers, and provides insights into identifying lucrative opportunities.

### Understanding the Classic Gambler's Dilemma:
Every bookmaker or platform has its own perspective on events and assigns odds accordingly. Placing opposing bets with a single bookmaker guarantees a loss. For instance, imagine betting on a tennis match with Draft Kings, where the odds are:
- "Player A", 1.90 (implying a potential $1.90 return on a $1 bet) 
- "Player B", 1.75 (implying a potential $1.75 return on a $1 bet).
Wagering $100 on both outcomes would inevitably result in a loss, as the total expenditure of $200 outweighs the potential winnings of $190 or $175.

### Gambling = smoll brain:
The core distinction between gambling and arbitrage lies in the varying odds offered by different bookmakers. 
Here are some examples:
- Draft Kings may assign odds of 1.80 for "Player A" and 2.15 for "Player B".
- Implied probability = 1/1.80 + 1/2.15 = 1.02
Resulting in an implied probability of 102%, which indicates that betting is not advisable unless you enjoy losing money, since the total exceeds 100%.

On the other hand, Bet99 might present odds of 1.68 and 2.30 for the same players, leading to an implied probability of 103%. In both scenarios, betting on both outcomes with the same bookmaker would lead to a loss, while selecting only one outcome would revert to gambling (remember the title of this section lol).

### Arbitrage = big brain:
To illustrate the concept of arbitrage, let's revisit the previous example with Draft Kings and Bet99. Draft Kings offers odds of 1.80 for "Player A" and 2.15 for "Player B," while Bet99 provides odds of 1.68 and 2.30, respectively. Here's where arbitrage comes into play:
- Place a bet on "Player A" to win with Draft Kings.
- Simultaneously, bet on "Player B" to win with Bet99.
- The implied probability, calculated as 1/1.80 + 1/2.30, amounts to 0.9903 (or 99%), indicating a profitable opportunity!

Sure, that's cool but how do I know how much money to bet?
Simply based on the amount of money you want the outcome to be!
Let's say your desired profit is $500:
- $500/1.80 = $277.78 for "Player A"
- $500/2.30 = $217.39 for "Player B"
Place a $277.78 bet on Draft Kings for "Player A" and a $217.39 bet on Bet99 for "Player B"

No matter the match outcome, the total amount you wagered is $495.17, and you will win $500!
Consequently, a profit of approximately $5, equivalent to 1%, is attained.

### Identifying discrepancies and finding opportunities:
To identify discrepancies in odds and discover profitable opportunities, you either have to manually code a bot that will scrape every bookmakers' odds or pay to use a platform that provide such comparisons. 

Note : In sports betting, odds are commonly expressed in numerical formats such as "-125" and "+130".
- -125: This indicates that a bettor would need to wager $125 to potentially win $100. In this case, the total amount at stake, including the initial wager, would be $225.
- +130: Conversely, this representation implies that by betting $100, the bettor could potentially earn a profit of $130. The total amount received, including the initial wager, would be $230.

### Reminders/Warnings:
1. Don't gamble.
2. Some bookmakers will limit the amout you can bet, which can mess your hedge.
3. You will eventually get banned by the casinos.


## Happy money making hehe
